### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
To understand the communication between HTML, CSS, and Javascript. To learn the syntax and write a whole HTML and CSS file for the first time and understand the relationships that exist between all the file types. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
    I was able to write out multiple functions and several lines of code and on my first try with running the code it worked! I felt like I was actually capible of writing functional code on my own!

    When I was able to get the styling components almost all the way done the first night. It allowed me to start building the code to make things work the next day. 

    Finding a place to start was often challenging. It helped to write out the steps of what I would actually need to do then build the code from there. 

    Writing my first HTML and CSS files starting from very little was hard. I feel as though I understand the structure of how it needs to be written and how important correct syntax and indentation is for understanding the code.
