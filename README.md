# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> 
I built a page that you can go to when you need some self care support. You can either select affirmations or mantras then recieve your message. If you love a message there is a favorite button that can save it for you. Once you have a couple saved you can view all you favorited messages in one place. You can go back to the home view and continue to add to your favorite list.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> 
To understand the communication between HTML, CSS, and Javascript. To learn the syntax and write a whole HTML and CSS file for the first time and understand the relationships that exist between all the file types. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> 
- I was able to write out multiple functions and several lines of code and on my first try with running the code it worked! I felt like I was actually capible of writing functional code on my own!

- When I was able to get the styling components almost all the way done the first night. It allowed me to start building the code to make things work the next day. 

- Finding a place to start was often challenging. It helped to write out the steps of what I would actually need to do then build the code from there. 

- Writing my first HTML and CSS files starting from very little was hard. I feel as though I understand the structure of how it needs to be written and how important correct syntax and indentation is for understanding the code.
